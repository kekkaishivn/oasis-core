# Staking

The staking service is responsible for managing the staking ledger in the
consensus layer. It enables operations like transfering tokens between accounts
and escrowing tokens for specific needs (e.g., operating nodes).

The service interface definition lives in [`go/staking/api`]. It defines the
supported queries and transactions.

## Test Vectors

To generate test vectors for various staking [transactions], run:

```bash
make -C go test-vectors/staking
```

[transactions]: transactions.md

### General

### Escrow

### Commission Schedule

## Delegation

## Methods

Each staking service method takes a method-specific body as an argument.

### Transfer

Transfer enables token transfer between different accounts in the staking
ledger.

Method name:

```
staking.Transfer
```

Body:

```golang
type Transfer struct {
    To     signature.PublicKey `json:"xfer_to"`
    Tokens quantity.Quantity   `json:"xfer_tokens"`
}
```

The transaction signer implicitly specifies the source account.

Fields:

* `xfer_to` specifies the destination account.
* `xfer_tokens` specifies the amount of tokens to transfer.

### Burn

Burn destroys some tokens in the caller's account.

Method name:

```
staking.Burn
```

Body:

```golang
type Burn struct {
    Tokens quantity.Quantity `json:"burn_tokens"`
}
```

The transaction signer implicitly specifies the caller's account.

Fields:

* `burn_tokens` specifies the amount of tokens to burn.

### Add Escrow

Escrow transfers tokens into an escrow account. Escrow accounts are used to keep
the funds needed for specific consensus-layer operations (e.g., registering and
running nodes). To simplify accounting, each escrow results in the source
account being issued shares which can be converted back into staking tokens
during the reclaim escrow operation.

Method name:

```
staking.AddEscrow
```

Body:

```golang
type Escrow struct {
    Account signature.PublicKey `json:"escrow_account"`
    Tokens  quantity.Quantity   `json:"escrow_tokens"`
}
```

The transaction signer implicitly specifies the source account.

Fields:

* `escrow_account` specifies the destination escrow account.
* `escrow_tokens` specifies the amount of tokens to transfer.

### Reclaim Escrow

Reclaim escrow starts the escrow reclamation process. The process does not
complete immediately but may be subject to a debonding period during which the
tokens still remain escrowed.

Method name:

```
staking.ReclaimEscrow
```

Body:

```golang
type ReclaimEscrow struct {
    Account signature.PublicKey `json:"escrow_account"`
    Shares  quantity.Quantity   `json:"reclaim_shares"`
}
```

The transaction signer implicitly specifies the destination account.

Fields:

* `escrow_account` specifies the source escrow account.
* `reclaim_shares` specifies the amount of shares to reclaim.

### Amend Commission Schedule

Method name:

```
staking.AmendCommissionSchedule
```

Body:

```golang
type AmendCommissionSchedule struct {
    Amendment CommissionSchedule `json:"amendment"`
}
```

The transaction signer implicitly specifies the escrow account.

Fields:

* `amendment` defines the amended commission schedule.
