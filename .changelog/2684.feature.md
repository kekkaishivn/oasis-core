go/common/crypto/signature/signer/composite: Initial import

This adds a composite signer factory that can aggregate multiple signer
factories.  This could be used (for example), to use multiple signer
backends simultaneously, depending on the key role.

Eg: The P2P link signer could use a local file, while the consensus
signer can be backed by a remote HSM.
